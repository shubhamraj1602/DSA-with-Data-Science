        "makes the model more robust to small changes in the input. It helps prevent overfitting by\n",
        "reducing the impact of individual weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regularization techniques introduce a trade-off between model complexity and fitting the training\n",
        "data. By controlling the regularization strength, the balance\n",
        "between model simplicity and fitting the data can be adjusted to avoid overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe the concept of normalization in the context of neural networks.\n",
        "Ans. Normalization in the context of neural networks refers to the process of scaling input features\n",
        "to a similar range. It is performed to ensure that each input\n",
        "feature contributes proportionately to the learning process, regardless of its original scale or units.\n",
        "Normalization can help accelerate training, improve convergence,\n",

        "X_scaled = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)\n",
        "where X is the original value, X_min is the minimum value of the feature, and X_max is the\n",
        "maximum value of the feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "Standardization (Z-score normalization): It transforms the values of each feature to have a\n",
        "mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The formula is given by:\n",
        "X_scaled = (X - X_mean) / X_std\n",

        "function for probabilistic interpretations. However, it can suffer from the vanishing gradient\n",
        "problem for deep networks.\n",
        "\n",

        "recover during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Leaky ReLU: Similar to ReLU, but it allows a small, non-zero gradient for negative inputs,\n",
        "preventing neurons from dying completely.\n",
